## Facilitating workflow conversations

As a GitHub ambassador within your organization, helping people realize how to utilize GitHub as a platform and effectively collaborate is vital. The following activity focuses on creating a markdown-driven slide deck that can be shared with members of the organization to get a glimpse into how awesome life on GitHub can be.

When thinking about what content to include in the deck, think back on what drew you to GitHub. Was it the integration of Issue and Pull Requests that makes it easier to get things done? Or was it how easy integrations make including CI or CD in your workflow?

Regardless of why you ❤️ GitHub, include it in your deck and share it with other people in the organization to help them get excited about moving from their current solution to GitHub.
