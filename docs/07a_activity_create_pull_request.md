### Activity: Creating a Pull Request

Pull Requests are used to propose changes to the project files. A pull request introduces an action that addresses an Issue. A Pull Request is considered a "work in progress" until it is merged into the project.

Now that you have started to change your file, you will open a pull request to discuss the file with your team mates. Follow these steps to create a Pull Request in the class repository:

1. Click the *Pull Request* tab.
1. Click *New Pull Request*.
1. In the *base* dropdown, choose `main`
1. In the *compare* dropdown, choose your branch.
1. Type a subject line and enter a comment.
1. Use markdown formatting to add a header and a checklist to your Pull Request.
1. Include one of the keywords: `closes`, `fixes`, or `resolves` followed by the issue number you created earlier to note which Issue the Pull Request should close. Example: `This resolves #3`
1. Click *Preview* to see how your Pull Request will look.
1. Assign the Pull Request to yourself.
1. Select your partner as a Reviewer for the Pull Request.
1. Click *Create pull request*.

> When you navigate to the class repository, you should see a banner at the top of the page indicating you have recently pushed branches, along with a button that reads *Compare & pull request*. This helpful button will automatically start the pull request process between your branch and the repository's default branch.
