## Adopting the dream

As an ambassador, initiating actionable changes within the organization is your main priority. You'll need to evangelize Git's version control benefits and GitHub's collaboration and platform features within the organization. Knowing how and where to spread your Git and GitHub knowledge is one thing, but knowing how to tackle issues, deal with reluctant mindsets, or providing clear expectations is a situation you need to be ready for. Take some time to think about and answer the following questions in the next section.

### Discussion activity: Understand your role as an Ambassador

#### Be a Git and GitHub evangelist

- What does it mean to evangelize Git and GitHub?
- What are some specific ways you can do this?
- What can you do if they use a different tool that can be accomplished with Git or GitHub?
- What challenges do you foresee being a Git and GitHub evangelist?

> Promoting Git and GitHub internally doesn't necessarily mean going from cubicle to cubicle spreading the good news, but proactively identifying teams within the organization that would benefit from using the GitHub platform to improve their development processes. Identifying how a team is currently working enables you to identify why tools or integrations are needed for the team to be successful on GitHub. If they currently use Jira for their project management tooling, ensuring that they are aware of the Jira and GitHub integration is vital for helping connect the development process dots. If they are using off-the-shelf or homegrown CI solutions, determining how they can connect with GitHub will also help teams transition from their current development platform to GitHub.

> Being able to identify where changes need to be made is the first step to making changes within the organization. While solving current problems within an organization is important, it's also important to think how you can reduce friction and issues in the future.

> Moving teams within the organization to GitHub promotes a larger pool of potential reviewers or developers through a process known as Innersource. As more and more developers move from their siloed development process to a more open and transparent development method on GitHub, they can request reviews from teams outside their own to help reduce development time and increase the frequency of ships.

#### Have a clear understanding of the organization's expectations of you as the ambassador?

- How can you measure expectations?
- What issues do you foresee if you don't meet their expectations?
- What can be done to have clear expectations from both sides throughout the process?

> As a GitHub ambassador, individuals within the organization will have the expectation that you will be able to provide succinct solutions to any problems or roadblocks they encounter as they prepare to move or once they have moved to GitHub. It's extremely important to know what expectations each organization has of you as well as your expectations from them. Make this a priority throughout the process. Having clear milestones or checkpoints is a great way to gauge process for you and the organization.

#### Overcome reluctant mindsets within the organization?

- How can you help overcome reluctant mindsets withing the organization?
- How can you prevent these mindsets from preventing progress?
- What can you do to help individuals with reactive mindsets to be proactive?

> Let's face it, we've all been there. Changing a process can be difficult. As an ambassador, changing the mindset of, "It isn't broke, why fix it" can be one of your hardest discussions. It's important to start from what has worked with their process and then see where you can add what is missing instead of starting over completely; although sometimes that may be what is needed. You'll often find out that reluctant mindsets are based on previous issues they faced when a process was changed. Understanding the question behind the question is important with helping these individuals see the same vision you have for their organization.
