### Using Markdown

GitHub uses a syntax called (((Markdown)))Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to issues.

.Commonly Used Markdown Syntax
`# Header`:: The `# ` indicates a Header. # = Header 1, ##  = Header 2, etc.
`* List item`:: A single `*` followed by a space will create a bulleted list. You can also use a `-`.
`**Bold item**`:: Two asterix `**` on either side of a string will make that text bold.
`- [ ] Checklist`:: A `-` followed by a space and `[ ]` will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.
`@mention`:: When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.
`#975`:: A `#` followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.
`:smiley:`:: Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji id with `:`.
