### Using GitHub Issues

In GitHub, you will use issues to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. Issues make collaboration easier by:

- Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team has the complete story, both now and in the future.
- Allowing you to cross-link to related issues and pull requests.
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.
