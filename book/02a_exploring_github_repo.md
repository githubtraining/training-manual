### Exploring a GitHub Repository

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It is easiest to imagine as a project's folder. However, unlike an ordinary folder on your laptop, a GitHub repository offers simple yet powerful tools for collaborating with others. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Whether you are just curious or you are a major contributor, knowing your way around a repository is essential!

.Repository Navigation
Code:: The code view is where you will find the files included in the repository. These files may contain the project code, documentation, and other important files. We also call this view the root of the project. Any changes to these files will be tracked via Git version control.
Issues:: Issues are used to track bugs and feature requests. Issues can be assigned to specific team members and are designed to encourage discussion and collaboration.
Pull Requests:: A Pull Request represents a change, such as adding, modifying, or deleting files, which the author would like to make to the repository. Pull Requests help you write better software by facilitating code review and showing the status of any automated tests.
Projects:: Projects allow you to visualize your work with Kanban style boards. Projects can be created at the repository or organization level.
Wiki:: Wikis in GitHub can be used to communicate project details, display user documentation, or almost anything your heart desires. And of course, GitHub helps you keep track of the edits to your Wiki!
Pulse:: Pulse is your project's dash board. It contains information on the work that has been completed and the work in progress.
Graphs:: Graphs provide a more granular view into the repository activity, including who has contributed, when the work is being done, and who has forked the repository.
README.md:: The README.md is a special file that we recommend all repositories contain. GitHub looks for this file and helpfully displays it below the repository. The README should explain the project and point readers to helpful information within the project.
CONTRIBUTING.md:: The CONTRIBUTING.md is another special file that is used to describe the process for collaborating on the repository. The link to the CONTRIBUTING.md file is shown when a user attempts to create a new issue or pull request.
ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md:: The ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md (and its twin the pull request template) are used to generate templated starter text for your project issues. Any time someone opens an issue, the content in the template will be pre-populated in the issue body.
